# 🔥 Calories Predictor – My First ML Project 💻✨

Hi! I'm Muskan and this is my very first machine learning project using a real-world dataset 🦋

## 📊 What I Did

- ✅ Cleaned and preprocessed the data (OHE + StandardScaler)
- ✅ Trained 3 models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - SGD Regressor (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
- ✅ Achieved **96% accuracy (R² Score)** 🎉

## 🛠 Tech Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook on Kaggle)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to train ML models with sklearn
- How to evaluate performance
- My first experience with multiple algorithms in one project!
